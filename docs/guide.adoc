= Generating release notes using {name}

This guide describes how to use the {name} release notes generator to create, maintain, and publish release notes from a combination of manually written documentation and generated ticket descriptions.

== Prerequisites

* The commands listed in this guide assume that you are using a shell compatible with the Bourne shell syntax, such as Bash or ZSH.
+
If you are using an incompatible shell, such as Fish, adjust the syntax.
+
For example, the following Bourne shell syntax to declare a variable does not work in Fish:
+
[subs=+quotes]
----
$ export JIRA_API_KEY=__my-jira-key__
----
+
Instead, use the Fish syntax:
+
[subs=+quotes]
----
$ set -x JIRA_API_KEY __my-jira-key__
----
